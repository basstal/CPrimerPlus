 * @brief
 *   Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay, the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
a.	   Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
b.	   Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
c.	   Tax rate: #15% of the first $30
20% of the next $150
 25% of the rest
 Use  #define  constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current tax law.
